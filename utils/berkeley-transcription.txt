[Applause]
well I don't need that kind of hello but
thank you for that hello it's so great
to see all of you well let's uh let's
get started I because I I want to
talk to you about a lot of things this
is today's outline every week I will
begin with an outline of what we're
going to talk about I'll also summarize
the the things that I think are
absolutely critical for you to have
learned the previous week from lecture
and from sections today's outline
introduction and then we're going to
talk about something that I call
the paradox
this course
in terms of my philosophy of teaching is
not about answering questions
it's about raising questions
and getting you to think much harder and
more deeply than you have thoughts
presumably about many of the issues that
you may maybe take for granted so the
first thing we're going to do is start
with the Paradox we're going to talk
about inequality by race
it is impossible to talk about income
and wealth inequality
in the United States
and many other places around the world
without talking about structural
racism
they can be theoretically looked at
separately but they are integrated and
intertwined in so many fundamental ways
and we will examine
that
literally every week
and then economic Mobility
and let me just say something about that
before we get into it
we are
not only going to be examining the
distribution of income and wealth but
we're also going to examining a first
cousin which is how easy it is
for somebody who is born
relatively poor or very poor or lower
middle class or working class whatever
you want to Define it to move up
that's another very critical part
of the story and the questions that we
will be addressing
and finally today we're going to be
looking at a kind of a pretty basic
question should you care about widening
inequality of income
and wealth is it something that we
should be spending a lot of time on and
but but exactly why if it is something
you should care about so we'll get into
all of this but first of all in terms of
introductions uh there is a kind of
social contract this is something I'm
going to be talking about again and
again in the course
because
some of you are political science majors
and some of you are economics majors and
some of your sociologists majors and
some of you are history majors but this
course is
interdisciplinary in the sense that
in my view my humble View
after having
been engaged with this subject
academically and research-wise and also
in terms of administering and running
programs
my view is that you can't separate
economics politics sociology and history
they're academically separate silos but
for this course we are going to be
integrating them entirely and the social
contract is a very fundamental part of
what we will talk about explicitly or
implicitly and by social contract I mean
what we owe each other
as members of the same
community in this classroom
or Community as in Berkeley
University of California or Community as
in Berkeley town or Community as in East
Bay or Community as in people who
inhabit the United States

or as human beings
what do we owe each other
we're very comfortable talking about
rights we have a Bill of Rights
in the Constitution what about a bill of
responsibilities we all together
are a learning community I don't believe
that a chorus is a is a kind of place
where a professor or a lecturer kind of
depart gives you information that's just
a waste of time you can get information
from a book
a text
no
the sections and this classroom
are places where
you are hopefully
inspired
to ask yourself hard questions

one of the best ways of learning I have
found in my life is to
discuss something with somebody who
disagrees with you
now we have a little bit of a problem
here at Berkeley and that the consensus
is very strong
it's hard to find a lot of people who
disagree with the dominant view that I
would assume many of you have but that
means that in sections and to the extent
that we in this course have a chance to
actually discuss things
we have to
prize
respect and protect
people who have what might be considered
to be dissenting views they are
incredibly valuable to us
and if you do have a quote minority or
descending view not only should you be
respected but also you obviously that
discussion is the essence of learning
for everybody so you are a gift to us

uh introductions uh who I am who am I
well I uh
I've been teaching here at Berkeley for
maybe 17 or 18 years I never expected it
was going to be that long before that
uh I was teaching at a university called
Brandeis before that at a university uh
called Harvard
and along the way I also was in the Bill
Clinton administration I was an economic
advisor to Barack Obama before that I
was Secretary of Labor in the Clinton
Administration before that in terms of
public work I was director of the policy
planning staff of the Federal Trade
Commission in the Carter Administration
you've heard of The Carter
Administration
ancient history ah but before that
I was assistant to the solicitor general
in the Ford Administration
am I getting into ancient history for
you yeah and and before that I was I was
special assistant
to Abraham Lincoln as many of you
you know that
um
there's a very very tough times
but I've been so what I'm trying to tell
you is that I'm bringing to this course
uh some experience uh
what else can I've written a lot of
books my books are the kind of books
that once you put them down you can't
pick them up no that's that's a bad
a bad joke
uh that's all you need to know about me
uh in terms of I you
uh I've talked about what this course is
about oh one more point about the course
we are looking at the United States
because that's where we get a lot of
data no other country has as much data
detail data about wealth income
inequality and so on as the United
States uh but if you are an
international student or if you're
interested in inequality or a widening
inequality of income and wealth and
other things in other countries
hopefully what we begin to uncover here
in this course about the United States
will be useful to you because many of
the trends that have occurred in the
United States are beginning to occur
elsewhere
that is the United States seems to be
the leader quote unquote
in many of
these
dilemmas
uh who you are here's where the clicker
exercises come in so get ready
hopefully
uh so this is the first question this is
the first clicker exercise starting with
something very easy about you uh when
somebody asks you where are you from
you're most likely to say a California B
somewhere else in the United States or
see another Nation
now what I do in the clicker exercise
these polls I'll put something like this
up and then I'll say to you go and what
go means is consider it doesn't have to
be a perfect answer nobody's going to
know this is anonymous I mean nobody
outside
the CIA has any idea what you are just
clicking that was a joke bad another bad
joke nobody knows it's completely
Anonymous and then I will say after a
few seconds I'll say all right end the
bidding now it's been 22 seconds let's
end the bidding there and let's see what
the results are so you can see 71
percent of you 376 are from California
uh this is a public university I'm not
surprised it's the best public
university in the world
it's true it is true
and then but we've got a number of you
from somewhere else in the United States
and then about 70 of you that is 13 from
another Nation uh so there is a little
bit of diversity
one out of eight
people in the United States
lives in California
and let's go to question two
more about you okay uh my major or major
area of Interest falls into the
following category a economics B
politics political science or other
social science or C Humanities or D
Sciences or mathematics or E the Arts
go
and let's end the bidding there and see

well it's a kind of a cross-section
we've got uh we've got a 16 economics
and then we've got a lot about a third
of you politics or other social science
10 of you in the humanities almost 40
percent of you Sciences are math and the
Arts only 13 of you are in the Arts well
good for you
okay more about you okay when I was
growing up and this is actually more
uh self-revelation that is relevant to
the course certainly when I was growing
up I would say my family was a wealthy

purely subjective
right
B upper middle class or professional
C middle class
D working class
e low income or poor
again subjective go
and let's end the bidding there and see
sort of again understanding subjectively
there's a big bunch of you say upper
middle class or professional a small
number say wealthy but then the rest of
you are spread out middle class working
class low income or poor I want to just
stress the subjectivity here when I was
growing up in a rural area of New York
State I discovered
when I was in my 20s not until I was in
the 20s that we actually were quite poor
but I didn't know it because everybody
around me was
poor that is you don't know much about
where you are situated economically
if everybody around you is pretty much
the same it's only when you get a sense
of Relativity that you learn more about
your situation relativity keep that word
in your head because we're going to be
talking about relativity
later on
uh this is interesting this is the
self-reported incoming undergraduates at
UC Berkeley just the most recent data we
could find and one thing that sort of
struck me as interesting is that as you
get lower income working class lower
income more and more transfer students
now that's not surprising when you think
about it because a lot of people who are
lower income or poor they start at
community colleges
and they do very well or they presumably
do well because that's the way that's
the only way they could transfer to a
place like University of California
Berkeley so what you see is a University
of California system
that is actually an extraordinary
vehicle of upward Mobility for a lot of

poor or lower income young people
not ideal obviously a lot of things
wrong with it but there is a vehicle
that should be evident from this graph
now we get to the paradox
and maybe the best way of explaining
this Paradox is to take a look at what
has happened to economic growth
in the United States in the post-war era
now we're starting here
uh before 1950 around 1946 a lot of what
we do in this class starts around the
end of the second world war because that
is by just arbitrary definition the
modern era where a lot of economic
decisions and political decisions have
been made about the structure of the
economy 1946 is a key year it's a key
year because I was born in 1946.
it's a key year because George Bush
and Bill Clinton
and Donald Trump were all born in
1946. all of us within about five months
of each other
we waved at each other as infants

Dolly Parton 1946.

you heard her at the beginning of the
course she is a part of this course she
lives inside me I want to meet her
I want to meet her I mean she is my
height
we we believe in the same things I don't
know why I have gone so long without
meeting Dolly Parton if any of you know
us Dolly Parton or somebody who knows
Dolly Parton please
get to work there's not a lot of time
uh and you know who else would won 1946
share
I mean anybody who's anybody was born in
1946 and so we start with uh 1946 and
the question uh in fact I'm going to
review it to you right now is what
happened to the U.S economy beginning
after the second world war and this is
adjusted for inflation wow
that's called economic growth
and you see at the end I mean this is
the recession pretty bad recession the
pandemic recession but right now we're
sort of right there
and later on in the course we'll talk
about what the FED is doing
uh that may push us back down here but
this record
again adjusted for inflation
by that I mean we're talking about real
purchasing power
this is an extraordinary record
well great and then the question is well
who has got
all of that economic gain
productivity and the typical workers
wage compensation uh now here again let
me pause to explain something very often
in the course I'll put on the bare bones
of a graph and some of you
may be graphophobes you may see a graph
and just freeze
so what I want to do pedagogically is
explain it before I show you what the
graph is
and why it's important now there's this
graph that I'm about to show you will
show you over time what has happened to
the median wage medium that is half
above half below the wage of the typical
worker in the United States
over time and I'm also going to compare
that in this graph to productivity how
productive the typical worker has been
and what you will see is that
productivity of the typical worker and
wages of the typical worker Rose
together in tandem which is not
surprisingly
that's what we thought was the rule in
fact when I was in the Federal Trade
Commission in the 1970s and we were
starting with a bunch of economists we
looked at the wage data and labor data
and we saw that yes wages went up and

productivity went up and they went up
together but then I noticed something
and I remember saying to the the other
economists I was working with uh but
there's something going on here they're
starting to depart they're starting to
separate productivity is continuing to
go up and wages are starting to
stagnate a little bit
and the other economists that I shared
that I was the director of policy
planning but they were part of the
policy planning staff they said no that
can't be right
I said well look at the data hello
there's no that wouldn't happen well let
me show you
what has happened
and again we're going to look at
productivity growth and hourly
compensation
beginning
in
and and we're going to set it
at cumulative change and this is since
1948. so we're looking at how
changes in the median wage starting in
1948 could have been 1946 continued to
go up together and then I was starting
to see something around here
right 1979 1980 and this was what I was
starting to see productivity was
continuing to rise faster than the
median wage
what was that all about
how did that happen why did that happen
why that Gap

that's a paradox
it was a paradox in 1978 79 80 when I
noticed it and began talking about it
and other people began talking about it
and it became more and more of an oddity

we'll talk more about it
but the question for you is

well I want to show you this this is the
this is current dollars uh this is why
and if you don't adjust for inflation
none of this makes most makes sense just
look at the constant this is in 2018 in
terms of real purchasing power uh in
1964 the real purchasing power of
average hourly wages in the United
States uh was 20.27 and and then you get

you know to 2018 the latest data that we
have confidence in and it's 22.65 cents
so over this entire period of time uh
you know a very long period of time when
the United States economy is growing
dramatically the typical worker average
hourly wage is not
any better off in terms of real
purchasing power
this has huge

social and political implications

so where did most of the economies gains
go this is another clicker question but
this is more complicated
than the other clicker questions I've
given you uh a uh into business
investment
most
or be into government programs for the
poor
or C into to people who are already
wealthy
or D into Environmental Protection
Public Health infrastructure education
military expenditures basic research
where did you think where do you think
most of the economies gained since the
median wage stayed flat and the economy
kept growing well they must have those
gains must have gone somewhere where did
they go
now let's end the bidding right there
and let's see what you think uh a few of
you eight percent think it when they
went into business investment uh well
some of it did certainly and uh in the
government programs for the poor not
well you don't think only if you don't
think they did and then most 83 percent
of you think it was people who were
already rich what a cynical bunch of
people you are
and then uh into Environmental
Protection and not very many well let's
take let's take a look
as we get into the chorus
the reason these clicker poles become
useful is they help you to think and ask
yourself questions and then they also
guide me in terms of helping give you
not exactly the answers but data
and the data is since 1980s here's
what's happened and again we're using
1980 as the beginning we're we're
looking at the relative to 1980 what
happened to wages well we can see that
wages of the bottom 90 percent
the bottom 90 percent
uh wages relative to what they were in
1980 well they Rose a little bit
now I'm not talking about median median
is half above half below I'm talking
about the bottom 90 percent
and then we say that the top one percent
uh did much much better look at that
their earnings their change in earnings
relative to 1980 quite dramatic and then
the top one tenth of one percent

well that's
a fairly powerful reality

maybe you like it maybe you don't like
it maybe it's inevitable maybe it's not
a problem but at least we are seeing the
same
data
income growth has changed a lot in the
last 30 years
I'm going to put on the slide I'm going
to give you a graph that shows
whose income grew the most if you're
down at the bottom of the income ladder
how much growth do you get if you're at
the top of the income letter how much
growth do you get but we're going to do
something kind of complicated to this
graph and this is going to I'm just
warning you this graph is going to take
you even you graphophiles even people
like me who loves love the visual
demonstration of of information uh you
might choke a little bit on this graph
are you ready I just want to prepare you
okay
did somebody say wow
you said wow
I like people say wow do you know why
you said well
why I mean
why because it looks
it's sort of shocking
but for those of you who are not quite
with us we're what we're doing is we're
comparing 1980 and we see a 1980 most of
the growth in income was in lower income
people by 2014. look by 2014 look where
the growth is and let's just be very
specific the poor and middle class used
to see the largest income growth
but now and maybe Nikki we can move that
poll over so people can read that but
now at the very affluent
the 99.999
percentile see the largest income growth
in other words what we've seen is
a dramatic shift
in the structure of the economy

more dramatic than a lot of people know

again is it a problem is it not a
problem well let's hold that off but
let's at least see how dramatic the
change has been
uh and when I talk about the suspension
bridge what I'm really talking about is
a longer time series if you go back all
the way back to the 1914 1915 we're not
going to do this very often but I want
to take the largest of you and what I
want to show you is something that is
quite amazing to me it's quite amazing
because what we see when we take the
Long View is that in the between 1912
and 19
30
beginning of the Great Depression we had
the top one percent had a lot of the
total income of this country and down
here is the top half of one percent the
top half of one percent had a lot of the
total income in the 20s and early 1930s
but then as the Great Depression wore on
as we went into World War II as we went
into well after I was born
and Bill Clinton
and Dolly Parton uh something happened
and we had the greatest degree of
equality
we've had the top one percent had a the
smallest percentage of total income this
is before taxes and then around 1980 we
started to go back to where we were and
that's why I talk about it as a
suspension bridge because we seem to be
repeating some sort of
historic cycle
or reality
and one of the paradoxes we've got to
unravel in this course it's not
economics it's not
political science or politics is not
exactly sociology is what happened in
the middle why this period of time
roughly from the end of the second World
War through the 1980 or a little bit
after 1980 why did we see the economy
acting
functioning
so differently
than it had before or since
what was exceptional then
now I should tell you another thing
about the course here the first six
weeks
we're going to be examining
why
what happened
we're going to look at the why from a
lot of different angles
and dimensions
and then the last half of the chorus
we're going to be looking not so much at
the why we're going to be looking at
well what do we do about it or if we're
concerned about it what are the policy
areas and the policy implications
but we can't get to the policy part of
the course
until we answer the why part of the
course
because policy talk
without understanding what actually
happened
is an exercise in futility
some of you in fact next week we're
going to be talking about Capital
markets some of you
may have a tendency to want to vilify
certain people

Elon Musk
I don't know whoever whoever you want to
vilify people who are very rich powerful
I'm going to try to discourage that

because making this about certain bad
people
misses the essence of what happened
and also makes it impossible to have an
intelligent policy discussion
because this is not about anybody
Behaving Badly
or to put it slightly differently
throughout this entire period of time
there are people that behave badly you
always have people that behave badly but
what do we mean behave badly and
everybody is working within a system
the question is what changed about the
system

now this is important this is one we One
screwed together this is between 1947
and 1979 but this shows you that the
lowest fifth the poorest fifth of
Americans
they grew during this period
in terms of income
not height in terms of income
grew more than even the top fifth

this was a period time when we all all
inhabitants of the United States grew
together by income now I don't want to
glorify this period of time I mean women
were still second-class citizens
black people
Latinos were still second class or
third-class citizens this was not a
Gloria a glorified wonderful time but in
terms of the narrow issue we are
examining particularly with regard to
income there is an extraordinary sort of
growing together phenomenon now contrast
this with the period right after this
this is just before the Great Recession
and I I I bracket this before the Great
Recession because the Great Recession we
will see changed a lot of the structure
of the economy but look at what happened
between 79 and 2010
in terms of the lowest fifth got poorer
the top fifth started to move away from
everybody else
now we're not talking about the top one
tenth of one percent we're talking about
the top fifth the top 20 percent
something what something happened
in this period of time
what happened

huh we have not yet talked about wealth
we've talked about income
now I want to say something about wealth
wealth is different from income
in some very very important ways
income is measured as a flow of earnings
over a certain period of time usually a
year this is my yearly income this is
what I report if I'm reporting my income
to the IRS this is my income for this
year
it's a flu
wealth is the result of that flow wealth
Is wealth concerns my assets where I put
my income
I may put my wealth into the stock
market
or I may put my savings and wealth and
savings what we're talking about if I
have any at all I might put it into a
house
or I might put my wealth into a
someplace else to keep it

a pension plan
stock market wherever you put your
wealth if you have any savings your
savings are basically what we're talking
about
wealth results from that flow
total assets at a particular time but
here's the thing
income also flows from wealth

what do I mean by that
if you have a bunch of stocks you're you
have a lot of a lot of you have a lot of
value in the stock market you might get
dividends
from the companies you own or the little
pieces you own of companies Dividends
are the companies basically giving you a
little little piece of your ownership
stake back per year
not all shares of stock have dividends
attach them but a dividend would be an
example of making some money off of your
wealth
or you might own an apartment building
and you get rent
from that apartment building the
apartment building is your wealth
and the income from your renters is
income from that wealth
the reason I'm
talking about all of this is people get
very confused and policy makers even get
very confused about all of this
I mentioned
Jeff Bezos for example Elon Musk what
how do they live what do they live on
they don't live on their wealth
their wealth is in the stock market in
shares of stock of
Telsa Tesla or shares of stock of
Amazon or whatever shares of stock they
have no what they do is they borrow
money
from the bank usually a big bank and use
their shares of stock they're huge tens
hundreds of billions of dollars as
collateral
to get pretty good terms on a bank loan
and they live off of those loans
I'm looking at your faces
and I would say 20 of you have no idea
what I just said
but we'll come back to that don't worry
about it
um income from wealth uh this is also
important the top one percent here is
the top one percent uh more and more of
the top one percent this is a Time
series again starting in the late 70s
1980 going all the way up as close as we
can get to the present time in terms of
good data you can see that the top one
percent is getting more and more and
more of their income from their wealth

again my scanning of your faces
if you understand what I'm talking about
great if you don't don't worry about it
we will come back to this this will
become very very clear to you the
readings make these these things very
clear uh total family wealth this should
be very clear to you but here's the top
10 percent
in terms of wealth it starts in 1989
going through 2020 this is the top 10
percent in terms of total wealth this is
the
fit this goes up to the almost the 90th
percentile this is the bottom 90 percent
of Americans in terms of the total
wealth that they have accumulated
that's the thing about wealth
it's very hard to accumulate it
if you're not earning very much
you may never accumulate well
most people
and we're again we're talking about
in the United States
accumulate almost no wealth

the wealth they have
is probably in their homes in the value
of their houses
if they don't have a house if they're
renting
then maybe their wealth is in the value
of their car
and if they don't have a car
then maybe their wealth is in a savings
account
but most people relative to the top 10
percent
relative to the top one percent
have almost no
wealth
this again is important for you to
understand in terms of the structure of
the economy and how the structure of the
economy has changed and it's important
for you to understand in terms of what
has happened to politics
everything we are talking about
has a correlate
in the sociology and the politics of
this country and I might add
those of you who are international
students
if you were in France
if you are in Britain
if you are from Scandinavia you see a
similar pattern
emerging
emerging not quite
this extreme
the wealth held by the richest 400
Americans
the richest 400 Americans as a
percentage of the total U.S economy
let's take a look

starting in 1980
this is just 400

do you get the picture

this is not blaming them
let me hasten to say this is not about
them being bad or wrong or doing
something that is nefarious
this is simply about what has happened

the 18 richest American families wealth
as a share of total U.S wealth let's
look at just the 18. just the 18.

now let's pause
and look at what all of this has meant
in terms of racial categories now you
know
you've taken courses you understand you
are sophisticated enough to know that
race is a social construct

but it's a social construct that has
consequences
social consequences
in terms of racism
and not just racism today
but a history
that becomes more and more important
to explaining where people are today

which of the following is true now
sometimes I'm going to give you these
kinds of questions and they are intended
and you've got to understand they are
intended to just be a little bit of a
brain teaser I mean I just want you to
suffer a little bit not not suffer I
just want you to go just a little bit of
a of a not very hard but just a little
bit of a difficulty so this one and I do
this which of the following is true only
one of the following is true
now which is it I will I will go through
each of them uh a the real the racial
wage Gap
wages between
black people and white people between
black people and Latino people the
racial wage Gap is larger than the
racial wealth Gap
that's a
B the typical white families Financial
assets are three times that of the
typical block or
latinx or Latino family

or c relative to 1979 the income of the
typical black female has increased while
the income of the typical white male has
declined
one of these is true which is it go

okay let's end the bidding there and
then let's instead of my telling it to
you let's just look at the data

most of you say B is the one that's
false the typical white family is
financial three times not a typical
black family uh and uh relatively few of
you say a
H and then uh relatively few of you say
c
okay so most of you are bunched around
the typical white families Financial
assets are three times Latin typical
black girl latinx family uh well let's
just see
uh these are changes in wages by race
starting in 1979 again 7980 is the
critical beginning of something
something happened and let's just take a
look at this well what's interesting
here is this is relative to 1979
relative to 79
interestingly
we see
that black women
have done
relative to where they were in 1979
they've done pretty well
and white men
relativity were they in 1979 really have
are are worse off

well that's
important
for a lot of reasons we will come back
to
the racial wealth Gap
is substantially greater than the racial
income gap let's take a look
because wealth again is a cumulative
effect
and you can see that the racial wealth
Gap
here are white people in terms of the
wealth that they have
since 1963 adjusted for inflation
incredibly increased Grill very
substantial increase in wealth but here
we have Black and Hispanic or Latino
families not really keeping up at all so
there's a big difference here the racial
wealth Gap is much greater than the
racial income gap

and the mean value
of financial Assets in the United States
by race is it three times white people

it's much more
than three times

so
that's the data we have
the answer
was
it had to do with
paradoxically
black women doing much better since 70
relative to 79
then white men
relative to 1979.
now all of this is intended just to get
your mind
making you curious how is it what's
happened what a lot of very dramatic
things have happened over the last few
decades
well what were they
now we've got to be careful with
measurements and uh in your readings I
just want to put a little bit of a of a
warning sign average and median are
different those of you who have taken
courses it anything to do with
mathematics or anything to do with
measurements you wonder you understand
this because median is uh halfway
between the people at the top and the
people at the bottom and the average can
be brought up
just because you have a lot of wealth or
a lot of something at the top
the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal
and I
have an average height of six foot two
what does that tell you it tells you
almost nothing
also beware
individual household or family some of
these measurements and most of the
measurements most of the data we have
ultimately come from both the labor
department and the Commerce Department
of the United States some State data as
well uh they St some of them are
families some of them are individual
some of them are household income or
wealth just beware it could be that it's
confusing if you're comparing apples and
oranges
uh the other thing to be aware of is
whether we're talking about before taxes
and transfers or after taxes and
transfers and we'll come back to this
these are just warning flags
now in everything you've seen so far I
have controlled for all of these but
when you read all of your readings or
all of the additional readings and by
the way each week
uh we've come up with readings that we
gsis and I think are really quite
essential but then there are additional
readings for those of you who want to
get into the details and I hope you have
the time and inclination to do some of
the additional readings but my point is
some of this you just have to be ask
yourself well are there talking about
before or after toxin transfers also
Beware of the measures of inflation

because I've said now in this class
several times when we look at time
series I've said adjusted for inflation
well yes you have to adjust for
inflation if you want to actually talk
about the real purchasing power of the
dollar of a wage or whatever it is but
there are different measures of
inflation
they're not all exactly the same
it depends on what the market baskets of
goods is that you are measuring and
comparing
also Beware of the difference between
income inequality spending inequality
and wealth inequality some of the
readings
I mean in fact there's a whole bunch of
people out there who say we should not
worry about income inequality as long as
there is rough spending equality

maybe they're right

also samples racial statistics
I mean a lot of the US government data
on Race For example bunches all Asians
together can you imagine anything
more absurd
you're taking a big chunk of the entire
world it happens to be in the United
States and you're saying they're all the
same and we're going to treat them all
the same
well a lot of these categories are left
over from years before when it didn't
seem quite as absurd to categorize but
we've got to be aware of how foolish
some of these categories might be or
become okay uh Mobility as I said to you
earlier another dimension of all of this
besides income inequality and wealth
inequality we've got to look at how easy
it is for somebody to move up or fall
down
I mean if there's a lot of Mobility if
you uh born into a poor family can very
easily become wealthy through just
working and playing by the rules then
it's less of a problem than if you're
born poor and you can never get anywhere

so let's take a look at Mobility
uh this is a question for you it's a yes
no question we can do it quite quickly
are you satisfied with opportunities to
get ahead in America by working hard a
yes B no go
okay let's end the bidding there and see
what you think
overwhelmingly 73 of you say no
27 of you say yes this is if there's any

social compact
in the United States
this is sort of the essence of the
social compact
everybody
ought to be able to get ahead by working
hard by playing by the rules but if you
can't something's wrong something's
profoundly wrong I don't know what is in
your heads when you say no but let's
take a look at the way this question has
been answered over the last 20 years by
a random sample of Americans
uh well most of them
disagree with you
most of them say uh
they're satisfied with the opportunity
to get ahead by working hard but
interestingly if you look at the trend
line
just over the last 20 years the trend
line is downward and anybody who has
followed polls particularly opinion
polls and they're flawed in all sorts of
ways but one thing that's interesting
and Gallup does this quite well
is that even a fall of ten percent
is significant
it signals something

this too
we will come back to
social Mobility
by the percentage of children now here
I've got to explain again before I put
this up and confuse you we're going to
look
for each
quintile
each 20 of income group
how easy it is for the children in that
income group
to get into a higher income group

so let's just
take a look

and if you really want to look hard what
we're looking at here is a child born in
the bottom 20 by income
43 of those children
are stuck in the bottom they never get
out of the bottom 20 percent
by contrast here 40 percent of the
children born in the top
20 in the top quintile are stuck at the
top they never get out of the top they
stay in the top
now this is a picture
this is these are the last most recent
data we have that I have confidence in I
I think things have changed a little bit
I'm not sure which direction but the
point is that relative to most other
so-called Rich Nations
we now
have less
Mobility
down or up
depending on who you are born to
in terms of your income class that says
a lot about what you're going to be in
for the next 20 30 50 80 years

so the best way to do well in America

is to be born
rich
hate to say it like that

but it's sadly true
or maybe it's positively true I I just
put an evaluation in uh I don't know
whether it's sad to me
there are problems associated with lack
of Mobility
the percent of U.S children earning more
than their parents at age 30. now this
is really important in terms of the
morale
and
the sense of fairness and optimism

remember
I was born in 1946 along with Bill
Clinton and and George W and and Donald
Trump and Dolly Parton and and Cher and
and that was a time when everybody
assumed that they would do better and
their children would do better than they
did and they were right
to make that assumption
because most children and then
grandchildren did better than their
parents
you see how that can have an effect on

group psychology the national
understanding of the collective social
compact
and if that stops let's take a look
let's take a look now we're talking
about children born here we're going up
to 1984. children born in 1984 who by
the age of 30 are now you know getting
up there they have their own children
they have their own careers they have
their own uh well that's a pretty good
way of viewing it well let's see

only half
of children born in the early 80s
we're making more than their parents
my age 30.
in 1940 1945 92 percent of children

were by the age of 30 earning more than
their parents

we need to understand why
we also need to understand the
implications of all of this

now finally the last thing I'm going to
talk about today is should we care
and the reason I even bring this up
is because there are a lot of voices out
there that say we should not
and I want to talk to you about their
arguments because it's very important in
this class in your sections
very important that we understand all of
the arguments and that we respect
those arguments but we have to at least
understand what the arguments are uh
should we care no
one of the no reasons why we should not
care about widening inequality of
income and wealth and also lack of
Mobility is that the rewards of great
wealth
fuel entrepreneurship
from which we all benefit
or to say that in a slightly less
highfalutin way
without inequality or at least some
inequality of income and wealth there
would not be enough incentive for people
to invent
and create businesses
and create jobs
you need those incentives that's what
the argument would be and when you do
have incentives when people are
inventive when Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
and a lot of others are creating and
inventing we all benefit

secondly
it's not a zero sum game
it's not as if a dollar that goes to the
very super wealthy
is a dollar less
than you that you or somebody who is
poor has a possibility of of having or
earning no it's not it's not a zero sum
their wealth doesn't depend on somebody
else's poverty
we can all rise together we could we did
in the early you know between 1946 and
1980 you saw the graph
and so those people who say we shouldn't
worry about it we'll say well wait a
minute I mean there are things we should
be doing maybe about poverty but we
don't have to bring the wealthy down we
don't have to tax the wealthy we don't
have to we don't have to worry about
inequality

we can remedy poverty without reducing
inequality or wealth
and we just focus on poverty

since I came to the Bay Area
I've seen more and more and more poverty
it's evident to all of us
it's around us
there are more people living on the
street
they're more homeless people
well this argument would be if you want
to do something about that we can do it
let's focus on getting that done it
doesn't mean we've got to
reduce inequality because it's not a
zero-sum game

and finally the arguments of those who
say don't worry about this are targeting
the rich is socially divisive
I was on
television not too long ago debating
with a fellow who
I served with in the Clinton
Administration named Larry Summers
and uh we were talking about this issue
and Larry kept on saying why do you
continue Bob why are you continuing to
attack the rich that's socially divisive
why are you doing that we don't need to
do that
I said I'm not attacking in any
individual person and not even attacking
the rich
and Larry said it certainly sounds like
you are

so I want to play a little bit of a game
so occasionally in this class
will do something that is
a game
and the purpose of the game is to
elucidate to help you understand your
own values
and our Collective
social contract and this is a I'm going
to play a genie a kind of a an abstract
Genie obviously and when I snap my
fingers
here's the deal I'm going to offer you
and you've got to say whether yes you'll
accept the deal or no you don't want the
deal and the deal is the top one percent
when I snap my fingers
becomes twenty percent richer

but wait before you reject my deal
people in the middle become three
percent richer

and people that are near the bottom
remain the same as before in other words
I'm going to snap my fingers and nobody
is worse off than they were before
some people are better off
some people are much better off
but I'm a Genie
and my snapping my fingers is the
equivalent of certain public policies
which we will talk about in the second
half of the course and I want to know
from you
basically
whether you'll agree or disagree
so a is accept the deal
and B is rejected ready I'm about to
snap
go
okay let's end the bidding there see
whether you want me to snap my fingers
let's see go well
73 of you say you're going to reject the
deal 27 of you are willing to accept the
deal but those who are most of you are
rejecting my deal remember nobody is
worse off
everybody is at least somebody is better
off
in economics this is called a Pareto
Improvement
a lot of economists and people who are
persuaded by economists say this is
unambiguously good
well I'm disappointed in you
at least those of you who who voted
against this
why
you want the baby on the bottom to get
something
you don't want things to stay the same
you want people on the bottom to get
something but
but what but wait a minute nobody's the
people at the bottom aren't worse off
the people in the middle are better off
and the people in the top are better off
so why are you is it Envy what's going
on

wait a minute it's not envy but you want
your piece of the pie so you're willing
to sacrifice the middle and everybody at
the top
all right give you a better deal give
you a better deal

okay

I'm going to give you a better deal this
is my revised deal
and I'm sorry what's your name
spring
oh well
of course Spring you're the one I've
just
I'm so it's great to meet you in person

spring I got a better deal for you and
anybody else who didn't like my first
deal
you'll love this one
and you'll like this one too
uh because here's my deal top one
percent becomes 20 richer that was what
we had before uh the people in the
middle become 10 richer
um pretty much better than the three
percent and people that are near the
bottom two percent richer for spring
you got it they're better off better off
better off although okay uh and uh so
all those people who accept A and B
reject go okay let's end the bidding
there and let's just take a look well
more of you came along but you're still
a majority of you 58 still reject my
deal so you're willing to you're willing
to give up an increase in the gains at
the bottom for what why who else besides
spring yes what

wait a minute wait wait
there's no such thing as created wealth
oh oh well I'm but there is in the sense
that you've got inventors you've got a
an economy that is growing I told I
showed you how much the economy is
growing I mean you've got you've got
away all sorts of ways of of of more
wealth and more income being generated
over time as the economy come becomes
more productive I mean all kinds of
wealth my genie is just a a sort of a a
a a stand-in for what has happened
so what's the problem what's your name
Emily Lily Emily Lilly Lilly Emily Lily

Lily well what's your problem why don't
you you're willing to sacrifice the
gains for people at the bottom

okay let me just repeat what I think uh
you're saying so everybody else can hear
it you're saying that the wealth these
data on wealth or income increases or
even my genie it's not we're just taking
from Peter to pay Paul we're taking from
the environment a lot of this has to do
with uh the climate getting worse and
you don't like the fact that any
increase in wealth at the top or
anywhere is actually going to be at the
expense of the quality of life for other
people on the planet that's what you're
saying isn't it
so it's not about so much inequality
here it's about the trade-offs globally
and also in terms of climate
right that's that's what sort of what I
understand
well I understand and I respect that and
maybe
you Lily
and you spring
and others here
would find what I'm now going to suggest
another
quote-unquote game
particularly Illuminating along those
lines
it's an experiment
and let me tell you how it's going to
work
you all are going to be divided into
couples
now I don't mean you are going to be a
couple
I don't mean you are going to have to
live with a person but next to you but
every one of you just look to the person
to your right or to your left okay
and if you don't have somebody to your
right or left
if you don't have somebody to your right
or left then
then you you better find somebody
because
you're going to be pretty lonely in this
no you're not

okay here's the experiment uh I want I
want you to divide up into couples of
and I on my left the person on my left
is going to get
figuratively
a thousand dollars from me
figuratively
in fact let me give you the rules this
is very and and the rule what you know
one rule here is complete silence this
this game is only would work if
everybody's doing it in silence
this is a learning game
uh so and rule is you form couples and
the person on my left is person a and
the person on my right is person B
so
are you two so you're a and your B

uh you need neither knows the other
now if if you guys are best friends it's
not going to work or but you've got to
get into a mindset in which you don't
really know each other
and this is a one time only
exchange that we're going to be talking
about ordeal I offer a thousand dollars
to a and a offers a portion to B and
writes it down in complete silence
and then B accepts by writing yes or
rejects by writing no and my thousand
dollars offer offer goes through only if
B accepts
so what I'd like you to do in complete
silence is to do this now
and when you're done just put up your
hands and then I want to examine it
your deal
when you're done put up your hands if
you're are okay
uh okay now what I would like to do next

is
and this is question number nine
if you were a person a
I want to know how much
you offered person B
uh now a is more than five hundred
dollars
B is between 10 and 500 dollars
C is between one dollar
and nine dollars
and D is zero
so again this is only to be answered by
A's and let's take a look and see okay
uh the majority vast majority of you
were between 10 and 500 but we do have a
few of you offered more than 500 and
we've got 15 of you who offered between
one and nine dollars and we've got 11 of
you who offered zero now I would like to
talk to somebody who offered between one
dollar and nine dollars
okay
you offered
was you offered be
what's your name
Henry
Henry how much did you offer
be a dollar

did you accept the dollar
you did not
Henry do you realize you just forfeited

900 I mean you forfeited a lot of money
did you expect
that your name
Graham did you expect that Graham would
agree
you hoped he would
but that's not my question did you
expect Graham to agree to one dollar
no
then why did you offer him
um
you you want to make a point
well you made a point
I'm not sure it's the point you wanted
to make but what point did you want to
make
oh I see you're reminded to make a point
that Graham was would be better off
but Graham
you rejected a dollar now that means you
could have had a dollar Graham
and why did you reject the dollar
you would have accepted ten dollars
but why did you reject one dollar

you can't do anything with a dollar yes
you can
you could you know you could
buy yourself one fifth of a cup of
coffee or
I mean what you mean in other words ten
dollars would have done it for you
Graham
Graham wait a minute I want to just make
sure I understand you would have
accepted ten dollars

spring
hold it so
so I well so you've how do you feel
about that
fine
all right
anybody else anybody else out there who
offered sort of
one dollar ten dollars nobody else
nobody well I know you did because I I
have the evidence up here
uh what I'd like the reason I'm I'm
asking is because I want to get at what
it was that made you think
that b would accept
one dollar or five dollars I mean it
must have been something like
B is better off than b was before
like we saw right here
all right let me ask a different
question is there anybody who offered
more than 500
okay right here
what's your name
Jay you offered more than 500 why did
you offer more than 500.

because you're guaranteed an acceptance
and you thought that offering less than
500 might jeopardize
the whole thing
and your
B
yeah and you and and your name I'm sorry

yeah and you and you accepted would you
have accepted something less than 500
how much less than 500
.
you I'm sorry
you would accept anything

I mean
let me just stop for a second and just
explain what we're doing here
we are engaged in a little bit of an
experiment about fairness

we all carry around in our heads
some notion of what is
quote unquote Fair
and some of us have very strong ideas
about fairness and some of us have kind
of mushy ideas about fairness but in
terms of the game we just did
we are putting ourselves in the position
of somebody next to us
in terms of trying to guess what they
think is fair
if you were an a person but a b person
you are responding to your own sense of
fairness or unfairness and if you have a
very very strong sense of what's fair
and unfair you might say no even to a
very strong offer if the offer is less
than say five hundred dollars
you might
and we could go on and on and I wish
there were there was time and I wish I
could go
interview you and we could all interview
each other but you understand
that's essentially what we are doing
the purely Pareto Improvement optimal
assumption efficiency economics assumes
that any gain by B would be enough

to make that trade
a good trade
just like the genie
nobody loses anything everybody games
but what intrudes on the genie game is
the same thing that intruded for some of
you on the little thousand dollar game
we just did and that is your own sense
of something about it maybe being unfair

and what we need to do is unpack what
that is
we don't have time to do that maybe
hopefully in your sections
you can do it but it's important because
as we diagnose
what has happened to the economy what
has happened to inequality why we're
concerned about inequality if we are
as we investigate
our Notions of fairness or lack of
fairness
become profoundly important
and we've got to understand where they
come from
let me just end on this little anecdote
in 20 well when I was Secretary of Labor
I would all the time go out to Ohio and
Pennsylvania and North Carolina and
other places where there are a lot of
unionized workers and a lot of
manufacturing workers and a lot of
non-unionized workers I didn't consider
myself Secretary of just unionized
America I was Secretary of Labor and I
would go out and I would talk with
thousands and thousands and thousands of
workers hourly wage workers and that was
in 1990
starting in 1993 four five six seven uh
and what I found as I went out to talk
with these workers is a little bit of
feeling of being treated unfairly now it
wasn't dramatic it wasn't that they were
absolutely angry but I kind of conducted
a free-floating focus group if you want
to put it that way I would talk to the
you know how are you doing how's your
family doing how's your job and we'd get
into their feelings about the system not

treating them quite fairly
you know the bosses are doing great the
executives are doing great uh the stock
market blah blah blah blah and I'd pick
up something
everywhere I went
unionized or non-unionized and then in
2016 years later I went back to these
same States sometimes the same people
often their children once in two or
three instances their grandchildren and
we would talk about just how they're
getting on we'd have these discussions a
free-floating focus group
but I'd ask them the same kind of
questions
and what I picked up was much more anger

now what I picked up
is exactly what you saw in a lot of
today's charts they didn't put it in
terms of
these charts
they put it in terms of how they felt
subjectively about
the way the economy was run the way the
system was run the way politics was
being undertaken the way the powerful
people treated them they were not
Democrats or Republicans they didn't put
Democrats or Republicans the first thing
they didn't
they didn't begin with their political
philosophy they just began with their
their feelings about how they were being
treated and they were angrier
substantially angrier in 2016 than they
were 20 years before
and then I would ask them in 2016.
well who are you interested in in terms
of
presidency I mean we were just on the
verge of the 2016 election uh we were
still months away in fact we were still
before the nomination but we were on the
verge of the 2016 election and I'd say
well who's who's interesting to you
and over and over and over again in Ohio
and Michigan and Minnesota and North
Carolina and I mean I would hear in
Pennsylvania the same two names

Bernie Sanders
and Donald Trump
often from the same people

now I want to suggest to you
that the subject of this class

is directly and powerfully related
to the subject of democracy
and the quality
and capacity of our country
to survive whether you are worried about
climate change or you're worried about
anything else
I want to suggest to you that much of
what we are going to be talking about
over the next 14 weeks is happening now

this is not an exercise in theory this
is an exercise in understanding reality
understanding a system a political
economic system moving through time

it's going to be a wild ride thank you
for joining me
[Applause]
